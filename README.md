The .qasm files in this directory can be compiled into either png of pdf files by running ./qasm2png file.qasm or ./qasm2pdf file.qasm respectively.
However qasm2pdf seems quite shell specific and qasm2png requires some non standard commands, so the pdfs required to compile main.tex have been added.
